Introduction In this task, we can make a radical design for Fora Form
Design Brief The backrest of Bother-Sofa is made of elastic rubber band and the user will feel the “wave” if another colleague joins of leave the set.
Unlike normal office furniture which tries their best to avoid the influence between the colleagues, Bother-Sofa aims at making the colleagues to bother others when they sit or leave the sofa, encouraging them to talk, interactive with others and arouse their empathy through this &amp;ldquo;bothering experience&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Design brief This design lets the children plan the movements of hands in advance. Then they can control the angle, the barrel and the mechanical arm to finish the action. In the process, children could understand that even the complex arm movements can be disassembled into several simple and repeated steps. Therefore, it contributes to the cultivation of children’s programming thinking.

      <description>Design brief Product system is generated by incorporating smart working light, smart blinds and solar tracking station together. Blinds are adjusted according to the solar position and reflections of buildings. Indoor illumination and colour temperature are regulated based on screened illumination, eliminating unnecessary power consumption and therefore achieving satisfactory results.
