      <description>Introduction This is a 4 weeks task, we need to find a set of images and make an app for this image set focusing on Ui &amp;amp; UX. My image set is a collection of birds and I want to make a bird species guide from it.
Brief A funnier bird species guide aims at encouraging people to know and explore more bird species. Users can view and recognize the birds thorough the sounds, location and drawing, besides that, users can also recognize the bird species by photos and add those bird species into their collection just like a bird version Pokémon Go.</description>

      <description>Design brief Information is the essence of life. This design focuses on propagating a certain kind of electromagnetic waves towards the universe which is based on the analysis of the DNA of the pets. As a result, the traces of the pets’ life can stay for a rather long time, or even forever. This way of handling the body of pets doesn’t occupy any physical space. This kind of electromagnetic waves can’t be touched or felt by human, however, they do exist.</description>

We invite the elderly people to join us and divide them into groups. At the beginning, we will provide lectures，workshops and materials to teach them planting skills. Then there will be parent-child activities, cooperation with community kindergartens, and so on.
